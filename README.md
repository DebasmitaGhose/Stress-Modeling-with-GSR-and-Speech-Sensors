Stress Modeling with Speech and Galvanic Skin Response Sensor 

## Data Collection
• Form groups of 4 or 5 students  
• Prepare the affectiva band  
• Prepare an audio recorder and a timer  
o Each subject/participant will wear it for 10 minutes when s/he will be asked to
relax.  
o Stressful Period: Each subject will then be asked to perform a public speech task
for 5 to 10 minutes  
o No-Stress Period: Each subject will then be asked to relax and read a book for 5
minutes  
o Keep both the affectiva band and the audio recorder to record all the sessions  
o Keep log of the start and end of each periods with a timer
